# Objectives
# 1) Check if two words are anagrams
# 2) Check for uppercase/lowercase
# 3) Needs to have a vowel in the word, otherwise return "Need to input actual words"
# 4) If it's not an anagram, check to see if it's an antigram
#   "a word is an "antigram" of another word if no letters match. For example, "hi" has no matches with "bye". The method should return something like this if there are no letter matches: "These words have no letter matches and are antigrams."
# 5) Two sentences compared as an anagram and antigram
